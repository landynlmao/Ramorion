# JavaBot
JavaScript and TypeScript bot i'm working on for fun. No where near completion.

You will need .env file with your OWN discord bots API token inside of that file in order to use it with this bot, I will not provide this one for obvious reasons.
You will also need to import your own node_modules which will not be uploaded her due to its file size.
